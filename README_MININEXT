This file describes how to use the sample quagga-ixp topology
provided with MiniNet.  The quagga-ixp topology simulates a small
network w/a few ASes connected to each other via a switch.  Each AS is
simulated by a single Quagga router.

1)Clone MiniNet and build it.

2)Cd to examples/quagga-ixp.

3)sudo start.py

4)MiniNext should start successfully.  Type xterm a1 to get a virtual
shell for one of the ASes.  Then type vtysh in the shell.  This will
log you into the AS1's quagga router shell.

4a) The xterm command doesn't work on some machines. In order to circumvent this,
bo to MiniNext/util and run ./mx <host_name> to run commands inside the host.
You can als o ./mx <host_name> <command> to run a command inside the host and
return to your shell.
