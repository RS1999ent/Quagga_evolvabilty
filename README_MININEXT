This file describes how to use the sample quagga-ixp topology
provided with MiniNet.  The quagga-ixp topology simulates a small
network w/a few ASes connected to each other via a switch.  Each AS is
simulated by a single Quagga router.

1)Clone MiniNet and build it.

2)Cd to examples/quagga-ixp.

3)sudo start.py

4)MiniNext should start successfully.  Type xterm a1 to get a virtual
shell for one of the ASes.  Then type vtysh in the shell.  This will
log you into the AS1's quagga router shell.
