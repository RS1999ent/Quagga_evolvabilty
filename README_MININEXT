This file describes how to use the sample quagga-ixp topology
provided with MiniNexT.  The quagga-ixp topology simulates a small
network w/a few ASes connected to each other via a switch.  Each AS is
simulated by a single Quagga router.

0)apt-get install mininet.  Make sure it is version 2.1

1)Clone MiniNeXt and build it.

2)Cd to examples/manualQuagga

3)sudo start.py to start mininet with a default config.

start.py commandline:
         -f/--protobuf_config_file - name of file in current
         directoy or fully qualified path to file that contains the configuration in
         protobuf text format. By default, it uses the file named "protobufconfig" if
         this isn't specified
         -h - displays helpline for commandline options

Configuration format:

Each top level message is demarcated by a <begin ''messagetype''> ... <end ''messagetype''>

Each message specification is defined by the protobuf, QuaggaTopo.proto. See
the file "protobufconfig" for an example configuation. See documentation in
QuaggaTopo.proto for more information.
