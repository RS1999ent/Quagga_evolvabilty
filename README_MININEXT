This file describes how to use the sample quagga-ixp topology
provided with MiniNexT.  The quagga-ixp topology simulates a small
network w/a few ASes connected to each other via a switch.  Each AS is
simulated by a single Quagga router.

0)apt-get install mininet.  Make sure it is version 2.1

1)Clone MiniNeXt and build it.

2)Cd to examples/quagga-ixp.

3)sudo start.py

4)Type the following
sudo service openvswitch-controller stop
sudo update-rc.d openvswitch-controller disable

5)Test mininet by typing 'mn'

6)Run start.py in MiniNeXT/examples/quagga-ixp.  MiniNext should start
successfully.  Type xterm a1 to get a virtual shell for one of the
ASes.  Then type vtysh in the shell.  This will log you into the AS1's
quagga router shell.
