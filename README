To get an unmodified Quagga installation to work as if it were
installed by Ubuntu 12.04 LTE's apt-get mechanism:

1)Copy config/samples/quagga to /etc/init.d.  Chown it to be owned
by root and give root r/w/x permissions to this file.

2)In quagga-0.99.24.1 subdirectory, type: 
  ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/quagga --enable-vtysh --localstatedir=/var/run/quagga

3)Type: Sudo make; sudo make install

4)Create group 'quaggavty' and add 'quagga' user to it

5)Copy config/samples/{*.conf, daemons, debian} to /etc/quagga

6)chown ownership of /etc/quagga and all files to quagga:quaggavty.
To avoid issues, it's easiest to make all files in this directory
world readable/writable.

7)give user quagga permissions ot modify /var/run.  This has to be
done in a script or every time the linux box is rebooted

8)To see if things work: 
    bpgd &
    telnet bgpd localhost
