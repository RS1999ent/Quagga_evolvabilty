To get an unmodified Quagga installation to work as if it were
installed by Ubuntu 12.04 LTE's apt-get mechanism:

1)Copy config/samples/quagga to /etc/init.d.  Chown it to be owned
by root and give root r/w/x permissions to this file.

2)In quagga-0.99.24.1 subdirectory, type: 
  ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/quagga --enable-vtysh --localstatedir=/var/run/quagga

NOte, on the wisconsin nodes, I had to install packages texinfo and libreadline6-dev.

3)Type: Sudo make; sudo make install

4)Create group 'quaggavty' and add 'quagga' user to it
    sudo useradd -m quagga
    sudo groupadd quaggavty
    sudo usermod -a -G quaggavty quagga

5)Copy config/samples/{*.conf, daemons} to /etc/quagga

6)Chown ownership of /etc/quagga and all files to quagga:quaggavty.
To avoid issues, it's easiest to make all files in this directory
world readable/writable.

7)cp config/samples/quagga to /etc/init.d

8)Give user quagga permissions ot modify /var/run.  This has to be
done in a script or every time the linux box is rebooted
   mkdir -p /var/run/quagga
   chown quagga:quagga /var/run/quagga
   chmod 755 /var/run/quagga

9)Run ldconfig so that install picks up on new libraries
   ldconfig
   ldconfig -p | grep libzebra

9)To see if things work: 
    bpgd &
    telnet localhost bgpd
    vtysh

Note, must e user 'quagga' to use vtysh.
