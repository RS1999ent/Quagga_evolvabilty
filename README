To get an unmodified Quagga installation to work as if it were
installed by Ubuntu 12.04 LTE's apt-get mechanism:

1)In quagga-0.99.24.1 subdirectory, type: 
  ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/quagga --enable-vtysh --localstatedir=/var/run/quagga

Note, on the Wisconsin nodes, I had to install packages texinfo, libreadline6-dev, and automake.

3)Type: sudo make; sudo make install

4)Create group 'quaggavty' and add 'quagga' user to it.
    sudo useradd -m quagga
    sudo groupadd quaggavty
    sudo usermod -a -G quaggavty quagga

5)Copy config/samples/{*.conf, daemons} to /etc/quagga.

6)Chown ownership of /etc/quagga and all files to quagga:quaggavty.

7)Copy config/samples/quagga to /etc/init.d.  Make sure it is owned by root and executable.
    sudo cp config/samples/quagga /etc/init.d. 
    sudo chown root /etc/init.d/quagga
    sudo chmod u+rwx /etc/init.d/quagga

8)Give user quagga permissions to modify /var/run.  
   mkdir -p /var/run/quagga
   chown quagga:quagga /var/run/quagga
   chmod 755 /var/run/quagga

9)Run ldconfig so that install picks up on new libraries.
   ldconfig
   ldconfig -p | grep libzebra

9)To see if things work: 
    bpgd &
    telnet localhost bgpd
    vtysh

Note, must be user 'quagga' to use vtysh.
