To get Quagga to work as if it were
installed by Ubuntu 14.04 LTE's apt-get mechanism:

1) Install packages texinfo and libreadline6-dev using apt-get

2) Install redis (version used: 2.2.12 from apt-get) system wide 

2) Install hiredis (version used: 0.13.3 ) system wide

3) Add the following to .bashrc or .profile: 

export CPATH=/usr/local/include:/usr/local/include/hiredis
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

To add debugging, add 'g -O0' $AM_CFLAGS in bgpd/Makefile.am 

4)In quagga-0.99.24.1 subdirectory, type: 
  ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/quagga --enable-vtysh --localstatedir=/var/run/quagga

5)Type: make; sudo make install

6)Create group 'quaggavty' and add 'quagga' user to it.
    sudo useradd -m quagga
    sudo groupadd quaggavty
    sudo usermod -a -G quaggavty quagga

6)Give user quagga permissions to modify /var/run.  
   mkdir -p /var/run/quagga
   chown quagga:quagga /var/run/quagga
   chmod 755 /var/run/quagga

7)Run ldconfig so that install picks up on new libraries.
   sudo ldconfig
   sudo ldconfig -p | grep libzebra

8)Chown ownership of /etc/quagga and all files to quagga:quaggavty.

9)Copy config/samples/quagga to /etc/init.d.  Make sure it is owned by root and executable.
    sudo cp config/samples/quagga /etc/init.d. 
    sudo chown root /etc/init.d/quagga
    sudo chmod u+rwx /etc/init.d/quagga


---- The following allows you test if a base version of quagga works

10)Copy config/samples/{*.conf, daemons} to /etc/quagga and make sure all files are owned by quagga:quaggavty

11)To see if things work: 
    bpgd &
    telnet localhost bgpd
    vtysh

Note, must be user 'quagga' to use vtysh.
